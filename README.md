# -Education-in-Portugal
For the first Portuguese student survey database analysis project, I used SQL and Python
This is my first project in data analytics training (October 2021).
It contains 3 files.
The first "Portugal_among_the_countries_of_the_world.ipynb" is an estimate of the level of education in Portugal relative to other countries and GDP costs.
The second "Survey_of_student_in_Portugal.ipynb" contains various questions that I am trying to answer using SQL. Mostly it is the grades of students and alcohol consumption.
The third file Ttest_for_grades.ipynb contains a test for assessing the change in the average grades of students
